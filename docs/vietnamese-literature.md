# A guide to classical Vietnamese literature

This guide is literally [Vietnamese literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_literature) post on Wikimedia with more detailed (and I wanna add more books to the list). Gotta improve the guide later.

This guide is about classical Vietnamese literature, centering around works that depict its culture and history.

### A little bit about history of vietnamese literature

For a millennium before the tenth century, Vietnam was under the rule of various Chinese dynasties and as a result much of the written work during this period was in chữ Hán (Chinese characters), works written in chữ Hán were either called Hán văn or văn ngôn. 

By the mid-20th century, virtually all Vietnamese works of literature were composed in Vietnamese alphabet. 

## Folk literature

Unlike written literature, early oral literature was composed in Vietnamese and is still accessible to ordinary Vietnamese today. Vietnamese folk literature is an intermingling of many forms. It is not only an oral tradition, but a mixing of three media: hidden (only retained in the memory of folk authors), fixed (written), and shown (performed). Folk literature usually exist in many versions, passed down orally, and have unknown authors.

Myths consist of stories about supernatural beings, heroes, creator gods, and reflect the viewpoint of ancient people about human life. They consist of creation stories, stories about their origins (Lạc Long Quân, Âu Cơ), culture heroes (Sơn Tinh or Mountain Spirit - Thủy Tinh or Water Spirit).
